									<h2>Why Coding</h2>
									<p>Back in the heyday of MySpace, I, like countless others, eagerly embraced the trend of personalizing our digital spaces. Yet, I quickly grew weary of conformity and sought to carve out a unique identity online. So, armed with curiosity and a desire for individuality, I delved into the world of code, determined to tailor my page to my exact specifications.<br>

                            <br>

                            Before long, my MySpace profile stood out from the crowd. Images rendered at custom sizes, edges were meticulously crafted, and fonts danced in harmony with my vision. Every element bore the imprint of my creativity and ingenuity.<br>

                            <br>
                            
                            As word of my digital prowess spread, friends began to seek my expertise, and I found myself transforming their bland pages into vibrant reflections of their personalities. Little did I know, this self-taught journey into web customization would ignite a passion and open doors to a career path I hadn't even considered.<br>
                            
                            <br>

                            Fast forward over two decades, and I found myself at a crossroads as an elementary school principal. The demands of the public school system clashed with my personal mission and took a toll on my well-being and family life. It was time for a change.<br>

                            <br>
                            
                            Reflecting on my past and exploring potential futures, the memory of my MySpace days resurfaced. I realized how much joy I found in coding and designing, and it sparked a new ambition within me. With unwavering determination, I embarked on a journey to master the intricacies of coding, setting my sights on a career pivot that would marry my passion for creativity with the limitless possibilities of technology.<br>
